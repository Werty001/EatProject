# EatProject
 The project "Eat!" It started as a non-profit charitable aid platform, where each one could help in causes of need closer to or with a greater reach for those who use the platform.
It is based on the visibility of a charitable cause, with NON-monetary items. Our purpose is to encourage people to help those who need it, with the resources they have at their disposal, which are not always money. You can help by giving a one-on-one math lesson to a child in need, help dig a canal for a rural school, or simply bake a birthday cake for a low-income child who can't afford it.
